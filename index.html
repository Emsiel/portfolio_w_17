       <p2> Hi I'm Emma </p2>
        <p>Welcome to my corner of the digital world, where I hope to take a deep dive into new and old passions through UX/UI design.</p>
       <p1>I am curious about how design intersects life.</p>
        <p>As a child I spent each birthday visiting the Royal Academy of Arts in London where I would watch the newest artistic talents make an impact on the art world. I studied Architecture and Art History as I had a need to understand design choices and why things ‘worked’.</p>
        <p1>I am a lifelong learner. </p>
        <p>As an international educator for 10 years, I learned the importance of making things simple, visual and, always, accessible. 
        <p>My background in early childhood development gives me insight into how habits form, tasks are completed and lessons are learned. I have worked in 3 continents and gained rich experience from the colleagues I collaborate with. Teaching students from over 20 countries, my curriculum design was always a working canvas; making in the moment iterations to suit my students needs.</p>
        <p1>I embrace another’s world view.</p>
        <p>As an immigrant, expat and traveller, I learned to always ask questions, be open to new experiences and to embrace culture. </p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing this creative adventure with you!</p>
